# RiskManagement & Mitigation
## 4 Faces of Risk
  - <b>Outcomes-Based Risk:</b>
    - This face of risk looks at why people or organizations do what they do or set out to achieve their goals or objectives.
    - Note that each required or intended outcome can easily be inverted to identify the risk we wish to avoid. 
  - <b>Process-Based Risk:</b>
    - The outcome of using the processes is where we feel the impact of the risk becoming an incident. the process that we’re focused on as we investigate “what can go wrong” as we wonder “Why are customers leaving us?
    - Process-based risk assessment starts by identifying key processes, which, if they fail, could cause the overall system
  - <b>Asset-Based Risk:</b>
    - The possibility of loss or damage to that asset is a risk worth managing. Assets also lose value over time, reflecting their decreasing usefulness, ongoing wear and tear, obsolescence, or increasing costs of maintenance and ownership.
    - First needs to identify the list of assets involved, Without these assets being available and reliable, one or more processes cannot happen. 
    - Generally there are three groups of assets—information assets, technology assets (or systems assets), and people.
  - <b>Threat-Based (Vulnerability-Based) Risk:</b>
    - Identify the vulnerabilities on the critical path to your high-priority objectives, and then decide what to do about them in the face of a possible threat becoming a reality and turning into an incident.
    - A “total life expectency” view, considering every event on the path from start to finish. This is how we answer the risk manager’s three big questions: what we need to defend, against what, and how we do that.
