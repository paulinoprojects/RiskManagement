## 4 Faces of Risk
  - <b>Outcomes-Based Risk:</b>
    - This face of risk looks at why people or organizations do what they do or set out to achieve their goals or objectives.
    - Note that each required or intended outcome can easily be inverted to identify the risk we wish to avoid. 
  - <b>Process-Based Risk:</b>
    - The outcome of using the processes is where we feel the impact of the risk becoming an incident. the process that we’re focused on as we investigate “what can go wrong” as we wonder “Why are customers leaving us?
    - Process-based risk assessment starts by identifying key processes, which, if they fail, could cause the overall system
  - <b>Asset-Based Risk:</b>
    - The possibility of loss or damage to that asset is a risk worth managing. Assets also lose value over time, reflecting their decreasing usefulness, ongoing wear and tear, obsolescence, or increasing costs of maintenance and ownership.
    - First needs to identify the list of assets involved, Without these assets being available and reliable, one or more processes cannot happen. 
    - Generally there are three groups of assets—information assets, technology assets (or systems assets), and people.
  - <b>Threat-Based (Vulnerability-Based) Risk:</b>
    - Identify the vulnerabilities on the critical path to your high-priority objectives, and then decide what to do about them in the face of a possible threat becoming a reality and turning into an incident.
    - A “total life expectency” view, considering every event on the path from start to finish. This is how we answer the risk manager’s three big questions: what we need to defend, against what, and how we do that.
    
## Integrating Information Defense - A Layered/Structural Approach 
From the inner, most vital center of the organization on out, you might see these layers as follows:
  - Core functions, assets, and information are vital to the survival of the organization.
  - Key business processes allow trusted members of the organization to use core functions, assets, and information in the performance of their duties.
  - Surrounding those key business processes are a variety of support processes, tasks, systems, (and people!); their work may not be vital to survival, but it does facilitate success.
  - At the boundary to the outside world, one or more gateway functions control who has access, what they can bring in with them, what they can do as they interact with the organization and its information systems, and what they can take back outside with them when they leave.
  - Other boundary points interface with service providers, whether as infrastructures (like power, water, or transportation) or to deliver products as services (accountants, lawyers, etc.).
  - Other gateway functions monitor, control, or fulfill mandatory reporting and compliance needs, such as filing and paying taxes and paying bills.
  - Public-facing boundary points provide prospective customers or partners, the news media, neighbors, and the general public with ways to learn about the organization, ask questions of it, or offer ideas or suggestions.

## Key Principles When Planning For Defense:
  - Understand your environment so that you can identify possible potential attackers and differentiate hostile actions from non-hostile ones.
  - Deter potential attackers by having a visible, credible defensive capability and posture.
  - Monitor potential attackers for signs that they are preparing to attack.
  - Avoid or prevent the attack, either by means of effective deterrence, negotiation, or by other means.
  - Detect attacks as they begin, and monitor them as they progress (or when they terminate).
  - Deflect or delay attacks where and when possible.
  - Degrade an attacker’s capabilities by wearing them down (attrition), stalling them (barricades, obstacles), or destroying their attack forces.
  - Defeat the attack by sufficiently degrading deflecting, or destroying the attacking force’s units, weapons, and capabilities.
