## Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA)
- PDCA is a basic cycle of making decisions, taking steps to carry out those decisions, monitoring and assessing the outcomes, and taking further actions to correct what’s not working and strengthen or improve what is.
- PDCA framework at the daily operational level: What must you accomplish today? How will you do it? What will you need? Then, do those tasks. Check to see if you did them correctly and that you got the desired outcomes as a result. If not, take corrective action if you can, or seek help and guidance if you cannot.
- PDCA cycle don’t just happen one time... they repeat, they chain together in branches and sequels, and they nest one inside the other:

- <b>Planning<b/> is the process of laying out the step-by-step path we need to take to go from “where we are” to “where we want to be.” The most potent tools for planning are what Kipling called his “six honest men”—asking what, why, when, how, where, and who of almost everything we are confronted with and every decision we have to make.
- <b>Doing<b/> encompasses everything it takes to accomplish the plan. From the decisions to “execute the plan” on through all levels of action, this phase is where we see people using new or different business processes to achieve what the plan needs to accomplish, using the steps the plan asks for.
- <b>Checking<b/> is part of conducting due diligence on what the plan asked us to achieve and how it asked us to get it done. We check that tasks are getting done, on time, to specification; we check that errors or exceptions are being handled correctly. And of course, we gather this feedback data and make it available for further analysis, process improvement, and leadership decision making.
- <b>Acting<b/> involves making decisions and taking corrective or amplifying actions based on what the checking activities revealed. In this phase, leaders and managers may agree that a revised plan is needed, or that the existing plan is working fine but some individual processes need some fine-tuning to achieve better results.
