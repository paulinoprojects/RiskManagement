## Risk Management Framework
- Risk management framework is a set of concepts, tools, processes, and techniques
- Noteable reference: NIST SP 800-37r2 - Risk Management Framework (RMF)

### Organizational Leadership and Management Must Address These Areas of Concern:
1. Organization-wide risk management
2. Information security and privacy
3. System and system elements
4. Control allocation
5. Security and privacy posture
6. Supply chain risk management

#### The RMF 7 Steps of Activities for Information Risk Management:
1. Prepare
2. Categorize
3. Select
4. Implement
5. Assess
6. Authorize
7. Monitor

## Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA)
- PDCA is a basic cycle of making decisions, taking steps to carry out those decisions, monitoring and assessing the outcomes, and taking further actions to correct what’s not working and strengthen or improve what is.
- PDCA framework at the daily operational level: What must you accomplish today? How will you do it? What will you need? Then, do those tasks. Check to see if you did them correctly and that you got the desired outcomes as a result. If not, take corrective action if you can, or seek help and guidance if you cannot.
- PDCA cycle don’t just happen one time... they repeat, they chain together in branches and sequels, and they nest one inside the other:

- <b>Planning</b> is the process of laying out the step-by-step path we need to take to go from “where we are” to “where we want to be.” 
  - The most potent tools for planning are what Kipling called his “six honest men”—asking what, why, when, how, where, and who of almost everything we are confronted with and every decision we have to make.

- <b>Doing</b> Encompasses everything it takes to accomplish the plan.
  - We see people using new or different business processes to achieve what the plan needs to accomplish, using the steps the plan asks for.

- <b>Checking</b> is part of conducting due diligence on what the plan asked us to achieve and how it asked us to get it done. 
  - Check that tasks are getting done, on time, to specification; we check that errors or exceptions are being handled correctly. 
  - Gather feedback data and make it available for further analysis, process improvement, and leadership decision making.

- <b>Acting</b> involves making decisions and taking corrective or amplifying actions based on what the checking activities revealed. 
  - A revised plan may be needed, or that the existing plan is working fine but some individual processes need some fine-tuning to achieve better results.
  
## Risk Assessment
- Risk assessment processes typically summarize their findings in some form of BIA. This relates costs (in money, time, and resources) to the organization that could be faced if the risk events do occur.
- Take each risk and assesses how frequently it might occur. The expected cost of these risks (their costs multiplied by their frequencies and probabilities of occurrences, across the organization) represents the anticipated financial impact of that risk, over time; this is a key input to making risk mitigation or control choices.

#### Quantitative Risk Assessment: Risk by the Numbers
Quantitative assessments use simple techniques (like counting possible occurrences, or estimating how often they might occur) along with estimates of the typical cost of each loss:
- <b>Single loss expectancy (SLE):</b> USLE is the total cost you can reasonably expect should the risk event occur such as immediate and delayed costs, direct and indirect costs, costs of repairs, and restoration.
- <b>Annual rate of occurrence (ARO):</b> ARO is an estimate of how often during a single year this event could reasonably be expected to occur.
- <b>Annual loss expectancy (ALE):</b> ALE is the total expected losses for a given year and is determined by multiplying the SLE by the ARO.
- <b>Safeguard value:</b> This is the estimated cost to implement and operate the chosen risk mitigation control. You cannot know this until you’ve chosen a risk control or countermeasure and an implementation plan for it; we’ll cover that in the next chapter.
- <b>Recovery time objective:</b> RTO is the amount of time in which system functionality or ability to perform the business process must be back in operation.
- <b>Recovery point objective:</b> RPO measures the data loss that is tolerable to the organization.

#### Qualitative Risk Assessment: Risk by Characteristics
Qualitative assessments focus on an inherent quality, aspect, or characteristic of the risk as it relates to the outcome(s) of a risk occurrence. “Loss of business” could be losing a few customers, losing many customers, or closing the doors and going out of business entirely!

## The Risk Register
A central repository or knowledge bank of the risks that have been identified in its business and business process systems. 
This register should be a living document, constantly refreshed as the company moves from risk identification through mitigation to the “new normal” of operations after instituting risk controls or countermeasures.
